# R2D2
A React HOC for ensuring your data makes it to your component in time. This was inspired to reduce the code required for the common use case of retrieving data from the Redux store, and dispatching an action to fetch it if it is non-existent.

It currently supports Redux out of the box, and any store that it can retrieve from context under the store key. Please feel welcome to contribute support for other libraries as well.

*WIP: Currently in testing, during this time the API is experimental and subject to change.*
